    "# Rumor Propagation Model: Daley-Kendall Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "We study how a rumor spreads through a fixed-size population by using a simple compartmental model.  \n",
    "Individuals are divided into three groups:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ignorants (I):** individuals who have not heard the rumor.\n",
    "- **Spreaders (S):** individuals who are actively spreading the rumor.\n",
    "- **Stiflers (R):** individuals who have heard the rumor but no longer spread it.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are interested in modeling how the fractions of Ignorants, Spreaders, and Stiflers change over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "The structure of the model is based on how individuals transition between states:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ignorants become Spreaders** when they hear the rumor from an active Spreader.\n",
    "- **Spreaders become Stiflers** when they interact with another Spreader or a Stifler and realize the rumor is already well known.\n",
    "\n",
    "These processes are summarized in the following diagram:\n",
    "\n"
